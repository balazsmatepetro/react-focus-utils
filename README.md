[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/okonet/react-simple-focus-within.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/okonet/react-simple-focus-within) [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/react-simple-focus-within.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-simple-focus-within)

This package includes:

- `FocusWithin` component — the missing JS API of the CSS `:focus-within` for React
- `WithSelector` component to allow preview of pseudo-styles like `:hover` and `:focus` in styleguides
- `mixins` — a collection of mixins for pseudo styles (`:focus`, `:disabled`) to work with CSS-in-JS libraries
